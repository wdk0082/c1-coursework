### Note
Boris *shows his solution* on C1_Research Computing on 11/28/2025 (Fri).

### TODOO
Things that are a bit 'too complex' that mighe need modification in the future: 1) frontend, 2) test suite.

We don't need early stopping. Disable that. Also, there are things unnecessary on UI site (e.g. multiple input inference?). Disable that.

PKL file, not npz file.

Why the data is stilled uploaded to my project dir? (should be container only)

More metrics for models: 
R2, training time, memory usage (train & inference)

Do we need another way (from UI upload) to upload test data? (see Question 9 last sentence).

Clean up dependencies structure (e.g. api & packages).

Be careful about the 'chmod +x' thing for x.sh.

Volumes or not?

What is the 'documentation of environment variable'?

For local installation, do we need a **single script** that can do (Installation + launch)?

Wait, docker need to enable development workflow? (last sentence of Q7)
